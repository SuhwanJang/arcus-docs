Arcus is a [memcached](http://www.memcached.org/)-based cache cloud developed by [NAVER Corp](http://www.naver.com/). [arcus-memcached](https://github.com/naver/arcus-memcached) has been heavily modified to support functional and performance requirements of NAVER services. Arcus supports collection data structures (List, Set, B+tree) for storing/retrieving multiple values as a structured form in addition to the basic Key-Value data model of memcached. Arcus is currently being developed and maintained by [JaM2in](http://www.jam2in.com).
